## Unique Value Offering

### Paths2Abundance (P2A) - Description

1. Paths2Abundance (P2A) is a global charity platform, which aims at helping **communities** around the world **help themselves**, through **frugal innovations.** 
2. Rather than donating direct consumables, such as food, the platform enables donors to pave the paths to abundance through **donation of solutions**, in the form of **tools, equipment, materials, methods,** and **information** that will help those in need to help themselves. 
3. All the solutions in the dapp are **"frugal innovations,"** meaning that they are **simple, low cost, easy to setup and use, portable, versatile, and  extensively applicable** for the benefit of humanity. 
4. The goal of P2A is **elevating humanity** through paving paths to abundance. This is done with **frugal innovations** and value creation ecosystems.
5. The project combines multiple categories of blockchain, including charity, NFT, and e-commerce. The project and the underlying database are designed to also accomodate a DAO in the future.
6. P2A is a composable platform, that can easily be extended with new Solutions, Organizations, and Projects.
7. Project is described with [extensive documentation](https://github.com/Just-Jam/Paths2Abundance-nextjs/blob/main/doc/Documentation.md).


### Benefits to Hedera Ecosystem
1. P2A is unique, in the sense that it is a hub of frugal innovation donations, rather than other types of donations.
2. To the best of our knowledge, P2A is to be the first platform of its kind in the blockchain world. While [Energy Web Foundation](https://www.energyweb.org/) has a [similar project](https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/how-energy-web-and-engie-energy-access-leverage-crypto-to-expand-solar-energy-access-in-faec75354e45), where donors can donate solar systems, their project is limited to only a single solution category (solar systems), whereas our system allows for all types of solutions in all dimensions of sustainability.
3. Since we could not encounter a charity application under Hedera, our system can also serve as a **Hedera-first boilerplate/template for developer community.**
4. Hedera developers can develop similar charity platforms in the future with much **shorter life cycles, turning Hedera into a hub of charity dapps.**
5. P2A platform itself, when all its features are fully tested and operations, can enable many stakeholders to participate in a charity ecosystem, increasing both goodness on earth, and also **increasing the visibility, popularity, and usage of Hedera Protocol, and bring transactional volume to the HBAR token.**
7. Project is described with [extensive documentation](https://github.com/Just-Jam/Paths2Abundance-nextjs/blob/main/doc/Documentation.md), which can make it much easier for developers to use the source code and the database dump.
