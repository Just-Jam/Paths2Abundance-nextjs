## Design Principles

When designing the **dapp**, [DDP: Decentralisation Design Principles](https://github.com/thisisbullish/ddp) by [thisisbullish](https://github.com/thisisbullish) was taken as a guiding source. 

When designing the **user interface (UI)**, the [Gestalt Principles](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles) of School of [M. Wertheimer (Wertheimer, 2020)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-36063-4) and the knowledge visualization guidelines of [Eppler and Burkhard (2008)](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/knowledge-visualization/25136) were applied. 

In **coding** the system, best effort was done to adhere to some of the [best practices of coding](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/top-15-best-practices-for-writing-super-readable-code--net-8118).
