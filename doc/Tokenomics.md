## Tokenomics

1. All **donations** are made **in HBAR**, in the form of NFTs. 
2. Funding for each project is represented as a **given number of NFTs**, each having same HBAR value to own. 
3. **Once all the NFTs for a project are minted,** the funding for that project is completed, and the **funding** is transferred **to the Organization** that will carry out the project.
4. The system accepts **payments only in HBAR** and sends only HBAR to the Organization. 
5. **Donors receive PATH tokens,** as a token for their donations.

### Future Possibilities for Tokenomics
1. Donors can gain PATH tokens as they make donations. The exchange rate can be changed to X PATH for every 1 HBAR that they donate. 
2. Governorsâ€™ weight in decision making can depend on the PATH tokens they hold, as a monotonically increasing function, with the formula Weight = SQRT(x), where x is the amount of PATH tokens the Governor holds.
3. Governor NFTs can be automatically minted for Donors who reach a certain number of PATH tokens.
